This one I was unable to add arguments so I just made the input and output paths within the code itself.

Also only for use with bills and Invoices along with their matching line files.

First create a new workbook with the bill and bill line in separate sheets.

Run Excel Processor and then data organizer.

Then use fix bill and code splitter after.

Next create a new workbook with the invoice and invoice line in separate sheets.

Run Excel Processor and then data organizer.

Then use Invoice.java and number fixer.java after.
